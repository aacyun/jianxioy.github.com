After much procrastination, I have finally gotten down to creating a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blog. I've previously used [Posterous](https://posterous.com/) (which was awfully slow) and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) (which was awfully web-based and mainstream). I've had this name since the [Blogspot](http://blogspot.com) days.

With a new year comes new beginnings. So now, thanks to the wonderful people at [GitHub](https://github.com) and [mojombo](http://tom.preston-werner.com/), I present to you the brand new [Blind Alley Graffiti](http://darylyeo.com)!

There are a number of reasons why I'd want a statically generated blog, the first being having more control over the customizability and ownership of the site compared to a cloud-based service that is always undergoing constant maintenance. Everything is also stored in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository which means I can experiment all I want and can easily backup my assets. Also, because of this portability, I can simply deploy my site on any host or server. If [GitHub](https://github.com/) ever goes down, at least I have a local backup ready to deploy at anytime. The site is extremely lightweight and [Github](https://github.com/) provides [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which is incredibly easy to use to host a site. This allows me to have my mind at ease on a ton of the nitty-gritty stuff and focus on writing great blog posts.

Many thanks to all my "beta testers" [Ming Han](http://hanworks.tumblr.com/), [Lucas](lucas-hacking.blogspot.com), [Christina](http://christinajeeves.com/) and [Jim](http://jimjh.com/) who helped me in critiquing the design of the site. Thanks to all the kind folks who hosted their blogs on [GitHub](https://github.com) so that I can learn the workings of a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) site as well as gain inspiration from your blog designs. Special thanks to [Jason](http://visualchen.com/) for helping a noob out with CSS. This exercise was really helpful and a ton of fun. I learnt the frustrations of building something responsive with media queries as well as cool and simple open source tools like [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I still have much to learn.
