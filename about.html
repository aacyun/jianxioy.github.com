            <p>I wish to utilize my knowledge I have gained in my life to make the world a better place. Currently, I am a work in progress and here is my <a class="links" href="#personal">story</a>.</p>

            <p>I was born in <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> to two great parents and I am the eldest of three. I grew up and went to school at <a class="links" href="http://www.marisstellahigh.moe.edu.sg/">Maris Stella High School</a>, <a class="links" href="http://www.sji.edu.sg/">St. Joseph's Institution</a> and <a class="links" href="http://www.ri.edu.sg/">Raffles Junior College</a>.</p>
            <p>During this time, I was involved mainly in gymnastics and <a class="links" href="#gamer">professional gaming</a>. I was also a student's councillor during my junior college days. I picked up simple scripting and decided that I wanted to learn how to make games so I set my mind to study <a class="links" href="#cs">computer science in college</a>.</p>
            <p>Before I went to college, I served my <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore">National Service</a> as a police officer in the <a class="links" href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/">Singapore Police Force</a>. As a police officer, I saw the best and worst sides of people. There were also some things which I wish I never saw. It was an experience I will never forget and I am thankful for it because it played a huge part in molding me into the person I am today.</p>

            </div>
            <p>As I was serving my <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore">National Service</a>, I managed to obtain a full overseas scholarship from the <a class="links" href="http://www.ida.gov.sg/">Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore</a> to read <a class="links" href="#cs">Computer Science</a> at <a class="links" href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.</p>
            <p>At <a class="links" href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I made many new friends and learnt a lot from countless talented people. I took part in hackathons, founded the <a class="links" href="https://www.facebook.com/CMUFloorballClub">CMU Floorball Club</a> and joined the <a class="links" href="http://www.delts.org/">Delta Tau Delta</a> fraternity. After completing my undergraduate degree, I stayed at <a class="links" href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a> and completed a <a class="links" href="http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-information-systems-and-management/information-systems-management-mism/index.aspx">Master of Information Systems Management</a>. My time in college was a very humbling and fruitful experience. I am now currently residing in <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>.</p>

            <p>At <a class="links" href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I learnt that CS was not just about making games or programming. There were deep mathematical principles that formed the bedrock of most, if not all, CS fundamentals. <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">Algorithms</a>, <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming">systems programming</a>, <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-computer_interaction">human-computer interaction</a>, <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory">programming languages</a>, etc., were just some of the few fields I barely scraped the surface of. It opened my eyes to the world of CS and how these big ideas and theories were used to solve some of the world's biggest problems.</p>

             <p>It was also here where I met so many smart people whom I learnt and grew from. I have since changed my ambition to be a game designer and instead intend to utilize the knowledge and experiences I gained in college to make a dent in the universe.</p>

            <p>During my teenage years, I was a professional gamer. I played <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooters</a>, namely the <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake series</a> and the <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_(series)">Unreal series</a>. I had most success in the latter. This experience showed me what camaraderie and working as a team was like and I had some of my best experiences with my clan. We were one of the top teams in our country and even went a season undefeated. Of course, winning cash playing <a class="links" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> was a lot of fun.</p>
