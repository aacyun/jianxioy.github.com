            <p>I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore" alt="Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> to two great parents and I am the eldest of three. I grew up and went to school at <a href="http://www.marisstellahigh.moe.edu.sg/" alt="Maris Stella High School" title="Maris Stella High School">Maris Stella High School</a>, <a href="http://www.sji.edu.sg/" alt="St. Joseph's Institution" title="St. Joseph's Institution">St. Joseph's Institution</a> and <a href="http://www.ri.edu.sg/" alt="Raffles Junior College" title="Raffles Junior College">Raffles Junior College</a>.</p>
            <p>During this time, I was involved mainly in gymnastics and <a href="#gamer" alt="professional gaming" title="professional gaming">professional gaming</a>. I was also a student's councillor during my junior college days. I picked up simple scripting and decided that I wanted to learn how to make games so I naively set my mind to study <a href="#cs" alt="computer science in college" title="computer science in college">computer science in college</a>.</p>
            <p>Before I went to college, I served my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore" alt="National Service" title="National Service">National Service</a> as a police officer in the <a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/" alt="Singapore Police Force" title="Singapore Police Force">Singapore Police Force</a>. As a police officer, I saw the best and worst sides of people. There were also some things which I wish I never saw. It was an experience I will never forget and I am thankful for it because it played a huge part in molding me into the person I am today.</p>

            <p>As I was serving my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore" alt="National Service" title="National Service">National Service</a>, I managed to obtain a full overseas scholarship from the <a href="http://www.ida.gov.sg/" alt="Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore" title="Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore">Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore</a> to read <a href="#cs" alt="Computer Science" title="Computer Science">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml" alt="Carnegie Mellon University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.</p>
            <p>At <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml" alt="Carnegie Mellon University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I made many new friends and learnt a lot from countless talented people. I took part in hackathons, founded the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CMUFloorballClub" alt="CMU Floorball Club" title="CMU Floorball Club">CMU Floorball Club</a> and joined the <a href="http://www.delts.org/" alt="Delta Tau Delta" title="Delta Tau Delta">Delta Tau Delta</a> fraternity. After completing my undergraduate degree, I stayed at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml" alt="Carnegie Mellon University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> and completed a <a href="http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-information-systems-and-management/information-systems-management-mism/index.aspx" alt="Master of Information Systems Management" title="Master of Information Systems Management">Master of Information Systems Management</a>.

            <p>At <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml" alt="Carnegie Mellon University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I learnt that CS was not just about making games or programming. There were deep mathematical principles that formed the bedrock of most, if not all, CS fundamentals. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" alt="Algorithms" title="Algorithms">Algorithms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming" alt="systems programming" title="systems programming">systems programming</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-computer_interaction" alt="human-computer interaction" title="human-computer interaction">human-computer interaction</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory" alt="programming languages" title="programming languages">programming languages</a>, etc., were just some of the few fields I barely scraped the surface of.
